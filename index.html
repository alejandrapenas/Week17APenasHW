            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a freelance UX/UI designer based in vibrant Miami, FL, with a background in mathematics. My lifelong fascination with numbers 
                    and logic drives my problem-solving approach, both in teamwork and in hobbies like intricate puzzles. 
                    I excel in managing multiple projects, orchestrating teams with precision, and creating products suitable for diverse skill levels, ensuring client satisfaction and loyalty. 
                    My enthusiastic spirit fuels my joy in uncovering solutions and fitting together the puzzle pieces of each challenge.
